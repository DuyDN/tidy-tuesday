This dataset came out August 18, 2020 (I got it a day early). The page is [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-08-18/readme.md). The GitHub page also provides three links for more information: 

- The [IUCN main page](https://www.iucnredlist.org/)
- A [study published in 2019](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/11/eaax9444)
- An [IUCN blog post](https://www.iucn.org/news/species/201909/over-half-europes-endemic-trees-face-extinction)

It's a little late, so I'm going to make a good round start tonight, mostly reading and doing the typical data skim with `skimr::skim()`. 

# Background


# The Data
The data comes from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species (Version 2020-1). It was prepared by Florent Lavergne for his [infographic](https://www.behance.net/gallery/98304453/Infographic-Plants-in-Danger).

# Tidy Tuesday
[Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is "a weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem." In this folder I add my own contributions, or half-contributions if I don't make a graphic. Sometimes I just explore the data for practice; other times I follow up with a nice visualization.

Published visualizations:

- NFL
- Extinct plants

Projects potentially worth perusing:

- NFL
- Hotels (a more in-depth data exploration)
- Spotify (text analysis and an unpublished Beatles graphic)
- Coffee
- Extinct plants

Unfinished and uninteresting projects:

- Australia
- Measles
- Passwords
- San Fran (although this has some mapping; it's very dense)

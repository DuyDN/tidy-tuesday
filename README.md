# Tidy Tuesday
[Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is "a weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem." I store my own contributions in this repo. All my contributions can also be seen on my twitter: [@charliegallaghr](https://twitter.com/CharlieGallaghr). 

Published visualizations:

- NFL
- Extinct plants
- Chopped
- Wheat Yields
- Friends
- State spending on libraries
- Everest
- Taylor Swift

Projects potentially worth perusing:

- NFL
- Hotels (a more in-depth data exploration)
- Spotify (text analysis and an unpublished Beatles graphic)
- Coffee
- Extinct plants

Unfinished and uninteresting projects:

- Australia
- Measles
- Passwords
- San Fran (although this has some mapping; it's very dense)

Goals for this week: 

- Use a new geom from `ggalt`
- Learn to use new fonts with the `extrafont` package
- Stay completely within R? 
- Maybe use `ggrepel` or `ggforce` for other things

See `fonts.Rmd` in the Tidy Tuesday folder for how to implement fonts. 


# Data
The data is crop yields by country over the last few decades. 

```{r}
key_crop_yields <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-09-01/key_crop_yields.csv')
fertilizer <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-09-01/cereal_crop_yield_vs_fertilizer_application.csv')
tractors <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-09-01/cereal_yields_vs_tractor_inputs_in_agriculture.csv')
land_use <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-09-01/land_use_vs_yield_change_in_cereal_production.csv')
arable_land <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-09-01/arable_land_pin.csv')
```

Normally I'd copy the data dictionary, but it's formatting poorly for the purpose at the moment. The only solution is to simply use the one on the site. Anyway, let's look at things. There are five datasets: `key_crop_yields`, `fertilizer`, `tractors`, `land_use`, and `arable_land`. 

`key_crop_yields`: Contains data on countries, continents, and regions. The unit of observation appears to be the geographic location and year. To get only countries, exclude rows where `is.na(code)` is true. For each country/year, there are observations for the crop yield, crops including things like wheat, rice, maize, and so on. The unit is tonnes per hectare, which means the data is already fairly relative. 

`fertilizer`: Again, country/year is the unit of observation. The variables include cereal yield in tonnes per hectare and nitrogen fertilizer use in kilograms per hectare. 

`tractors`: Same unit; variables are tractors per 100 sq km arable land, cereal yield in kg per hectare, and total population according to Gapminder. 

`land_use`: Variables include cereal yield index, change to land area used for cereal production since 1961, and again total population via Gapminder. 

`arable_land`: A single variable: arable land needed to produce a fixed quantity of crops (1.0 = 1961). 

Since these datasets all have the same unit of observation, I can merge them if I want. But if I don't that's probably okay too. Let's  do some skimming. 



```{r}
key_crop_yields <- janitor::clean_names(key_crop_yields) %>% 
  mutate(date = ymd(paste0(year, '-01-01')))
fertilizer <- janitor::clean_names(fertilizer) %>% 
  mutate(date = ymd(paste0(year, '-01-01')))
land_use <- janitor::clean_names(land_use) %>% 
  mutate(date = ymd(paste0(year, '-01-01')))
tractors <- janitor::clean_names(tractors) %>% 
  mutate(date = ymd(paste0(year, '-01-01')))
arable_land <- janitor::clean_names(arable_land) %>% 
  mutate(date = ymd(paste0(year, '-01-01')))


crop_yields <- key_crop_yields %>% 
  full_join(fertilizer, by = c('entity', 'code', 'date')) %>% 
  full_join(land_use, by = c('entity', 'code', 'date')) %>% 
  full_join(tractors, by = c('entity', 'code', 'date')) %>% 
  full_join(arable_land, by = c('entity', 'code', 'date'))

skimr::skim(crop_yields)

```

Merging didn't go poorly, but it didn't go well. Some of the years are given with a "BC" suffix, which presents obvious problems. This data is interesting, but I'm not sure how they calculated it. Consequently, most of the year variables can be ignored. I'm not sure how it handled year vairables when the value was NA.... I guess it merged no matter what because it was uniquely identified with a country and an NA, but that's not true is it. Whether or not it's useful to merge these remains to be seen. Probably it is not as useful as using them in their native forms. 


# A Look into the Data
Geography brings two graphics to mind: maps and flags. A classic is the lollipop where each lollipop is a round flag from `ggflags`. Agh... `ggflags` has to be installed from source, which doesn't work because of that stupid apostrophe in my file path. No flags then, I guess. I guess I could clone the repo on my dev account and compile it manually, like I do when I make my own packages. This is what I did. Let's see if it worked. 

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
d <- data.frame(x=rnorm(50), y=rnorm(50), 
                country=sample(c("ar","fr", "nz", "gb", "es", "ca"), 50, TRUE), 
                stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
ggplot(d, aes(x=x, y=y, country=country, size=x)) + 
  geom_flag() + 
  scale_country() +
  scale_size(range = c(0, 15))
```
Ah great.  

Anyway, that was only test code. I might also use the package `geofacet`, which presumably has a world facet? I'm not sure. Anyway, I could focus down on Europe or Asia, for example, if I'm more interested in somewhere besides the U.S. (and I am). 

As another experiment, let's create a lollipop of the crop yield of wheat for each country in the EU.  

```{r}
eu2 <- c('at','be','bg','cy','cz','de','dk','ee','es',
         'fi','fr','gr','hr','hu','ie','it','lt','lu',
         'lv','mt','nl','pl','pt','ro','se','si','sk')

eu3 <- c('aut','bel','bgr','cyp','cze','deu','dnk', 'est',
        'esp','fin','fra','grc','hrv','hun','irl','ita','ltu',
        'lux','lva','mlt','nld','pol','prt','rou','swe','svn','svk')

mean_hectares <- key_crop_yields %>% 
  mutate(code = tolower(code)) %>% 
  filter(code %in% eu3, year == 2018) %>% 
  mutate(mean_hectares = mean(wheat_tonnes_per_hectare, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  pull(mean_hectares)

mean_hectares <- unique(mean_hectares)

key_crop_yields %>% 
  mutate(code = tolower(code)) %>% 
  filter(code %in% eu3, year == 2018) %>% 
  mutate(
    flag_code = eu2,
    above_mean = wheat_tonnes_per_hectare >= mean_hectares
    ) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_hectares) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = wheat_tonnes_per_hectare, xend = mean_hectares,
                   y = reorder(entity, wheat_tonnes_per_hectare),  yend = entity,
                   color = above_mean), size = 1) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c('red','#1da616')) + 
  geom_flag(aes(x = wheat_tonnes_per_hectare, y = entity, country = flag_code)) + 
  ggthemes::theme_few()

```

So nice... I think the lollipop is not suited as well to static data. It's better at showing a positive or negative change over time. I could make a well-informed decision about two years to difference for each country. First, let me make a general-use EU dataset. 

```{r}
eu3 <- c('aut','bel','bgr','cyp','cze','deu','dnk', 'est',
        'esp','fin','fra','grc','hrv','hun','irl','ita','ltu',
        'lux','lva','mlt','nld','pol','prt','rou','swe','svn','svk')

eu2 <- tibble(
  eu2 = c('at','be','bg','cy','cz','de','dk','ee','es',
         'fi','fr','gr','hr','hu','ie','it','lt','lu',
         'lv','mt','nl','pl','pt','ro','se','si','sk'),
  eu3 = eu3
)

crop_eu <- key_crop_yields %>% 
  mutate(code = tolower(code)) %>% 
  filter(code %in% eu3) %>% 
  left_join(eu2, by = c('code' = 'eu3')) %>% 
  select(country = entity, eu3 = code, eu2, year, date, everything())

rm(list = c('eu2','eu3'))

crop_eu
```

So, they all produce barley, and they all produce wheat, and nearly all produce peas. Now, let's make the same plot but plot the difference in hectares from 2008 to 2018, which is just an arbitrary decade right now. 

```{r}
crop_eu_diff <- crop_eu %>% 
  filter(date %in% c(ymd('2018-01-01','2008-01-01'))) %>% 
  group_by(eu2) %>% 
  mutate(
    wheat_diff = wheat_tonnes_per_hectare - lag(wheat_tonnes_per_hectare)
  ) %>% 
  filter(date == ymd('2018-01-01')) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(country, eu3, eu2, date, wheat_tonnes_per_hectare, wheat_diff)

crop_eu_diff %>% 
  mutate(above_zero = wheat_diff > 0) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = wheat_diff, xend = 0,
                   y = reorder(country, wheat_diff), yend = country,
                   color = above_zero)) + 
  geom_flag(aes(x = wheat_diff, y = country, country = eu2)) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c('red','#1da616')) 
```

Pretty cool. I wonder if the line of intersection should be the mean or zero. Probably zero, since it's more intuitive. Would it be too much to do this for all countries? Yes, but only because of the codes. Let me see if I can find something and merge it in. 

Here's something. 

```{r}
country_codes <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasets/country-codes/master/data/country-codes.csv') %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

country_codes <- country_codes %>% 
  select(alpha3 = iso3166_1_alpha_3, alpha2 = iso3166_1_alpha_2, 
         region = sub_region_name, sub_region_code, developed = developed_developing_countries)
```
The codes I have are the `alpha3` codes, and I need the `alpha2` codes merged in. By the way, this data comes from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasets/country-codes/master/data/country-codes.csv). Love it. Anyway, let me see how this works now. 

```{r}
world_wheat_diff <- key_crop_yields %>% 
  left_join(country_codes, by = c('code' = 'alpha3')) %>% 
  filter(date %in% c(ymd('2018-01-01','2008-01-01'))) %>% 
  group_by(code) %>% 
  mutate(
    wheat_diff = wheat_tonnes_per_hectare - lag(wheat_tonnes_per_hectare)
  ) %>% 
  filter(date == ymd('2018-01-01'), !is.na(code)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(entity, code, alpha2, date, wheat_tonnes_per_hectare, wheat_diff,
         region, sub_region_code, developed)

world_wheat_diff_gg <- world_wheat_diff %>% 
  filter(sub_region_code %in% c(155, 39, 21, 151),
         !is.na(wheat_tonnes_per_hectare)) %>% 
  mutate(above_zero = wheat_diff > 0,
         entity = toupper(entity)) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = wheat_diff, xend = 0,
                   y = reorder(entity, wheat_diff), yend = entity,
                   color = above_zero), size = 1) + 
  geom_flag(aes(x = wheat_diff, y = entity, country = tolower(alpha2)),
            size = 10) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c('red','#1da616')) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Difference in Annual Wheat Production 2008-2018 (Tonnes per Hectare)") + 
  guides(color = FALSE) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(linetype = 'dotted', color = grey(0.7),
                                      size = 0.5),
    axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 10)
  )

ggsave(filename = 'crop_diff.pdf', plot = world_wheat_diff_gg, height = 8,
       width = 11)

```

In a good bit of luck, the country code dataset also has sub-region information, which I'm using to make this graphic with no trouble at all. 

# Ideas for Graphic
I think the change in wheat yield is interesting but arbitrary. Who cares how much wheat production changed from 2008 to 2018, or any other interval? If I can find a compelling reason to take the difference, maybe I can really use the flag lollipop plot, but barring that I need a different idea. 

I think an economic approach would make sense given the subject matter, but I don't have time to research anything. The only thing I remember about crop yields actually has to do with crop trading and purchasing power parity. In that case, let's look again at the variables. Each dataset is self-explanatory and fairly simple; there is no text to extract and analyze, the values are there in front of me. Then, I will probably get the most out of this dataset by including a lot of relevant data into a simple graphic. 

What graphic can accommodate a lot of data? Global-scale geofacets, maps in general, and maps would show that I'm capable of generating good map graphics and working with map data. Customization with maps is such a pain, though. I could do a very long timeline, wherein I show the trends over time of several key variables.

Radical idea: Show land use by filling in a fraction of the country's shape with a color. That would be somewhat hard., but with SF probably possible. However, reading it would be impossible without something more than just fill. Probably, I would turn each into a two-tone country, one tone representing land used, the other representing land not used. This becomes very tricky for a number of reasons, though. First, land use is an index of land used in `year` versus land used in 1960. This makes it unlikely that most countries would show an increase or a decrease over time. Second, the actual creation of the graphic could take weeks. The way I see it, you need to split each country into separate polygons, and I don't think this could be done (a) precisely or (b) automatically. In other words, you would be stuck estimating by hand and editing the polygons by hand. Not good. And how would you fill vertical countries like Norway, Chile, or Italy? Left to right? Top to bottom? It's unfortunately not a good idea. 

In fact, someone's done this with the U.S.! See [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/ijyn7p/oc_us_population_deciles_by_latitude_and_longitude/). 

Back to trends over time. Or fun iconography: tractors per 100 sq km, visualized with little tractors. But I think everyone will have that idea. Maybe the only way forward is to limit my scope, visualize some variables, and see if anything stands out. 

I just looked through the "Our World in Data" page; they have visualized a lot of this data and more, usually in line charts and with maps. For that reason, line charts and maps are out this week. I think it would be interesting to explore the relationship between tractors per 100 sq km arable land and cereal yield. That relationship might be tenuous, though, even if it makes sense. I wonder, though, whether there's a trade-off between plant diversity and agriculture in a country over a long time horizon. Too many factors. So many of these factors seem hopelessly complicated, to the point where their correlations seem meaningless. 

Points about each dataset: 

- Time is continuous, and will probably have a role in each.
- Any differences over time (e.g. 2008 vs 2018) will be arbitrary, unless they connect to some event. 
- Most of the non-time variables (cereal yield, crop yield, tractors, etc.) are sporadic over time and do not always show clear trends. 
- The data is composed of over 200 countries, plus land masses like Asia, the Americas, etc. 

To handle the high variability of most of the data, I could use means, medians, moving averages, bins, or other means of smoothing. But what about countries? I have two real options: show a subset or all of the countries, or use a single country as a case study. A case study country will have to be somehow interesting or related to me and relevant to other people. I could also compare two countries as a case study. If I knew more about development economics, I might be able to compare socialist/communist/fascist/capitalist yields. Accurate data is available only after 1960 or so. I could look at the delay in the effects of technology by comparing innovative countries like the U.K. and the U.S. to developing countries. I have developing country data, too, so I can look at the differences in the curves between developed countries and developing countries. Let me look into this. 


```{r}
key_crop_yields %>% 
  left_join(country_codes, by = c('code' = 'alpha3')) %>% 
  filter(date > ymd('1900-01-01'), !is.na(code)) %>% 
  select(entity, code, alpha2, date, wheat_tonnes_per_hectare,
         region, sub_region_code, developed) %>% 
  group_by(developed, date) %>% 
  summarize(mean_wheat = mean(wheat_tonnes_per_hectare, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = mean_wheat, group = developed, linetype = developed))
```

Another idea is a different lollipop chart, one like this: 

![alttext](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/ggalt/raw/master/README_figs/README-dumbbell-1.png)

In this case, it would be a selection of countries (some from developed world, others from developing) and for each I show the 1960 and 2018 value of whatever variable I choose. Let me try this with wheat. 

```{r}
crop_eu_diff <- key_crop_yields %>% 
  left_join(country_codes, by = c('code' = 'alpha3')) %>% 
  filter(date %in% c(ymd('1961-01-01'), ymd('2018-01-01')), !is.na(code)) %>% 
  select(entity, code, alpha2, date, wheat_tonnes_per_hectare,
         sub_region_code, developed) %>% 
  filter(developed == "Developed",
         !is.na(wheat_tonnes_per_hectare)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(entity, code, alpha2, sub_region_code), 
              values_from = wheat_tonnes_per_hectare,

  pull(mean_wheat) %>% 
  unique()

  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    text = element_text(family = 'serif', color = "#dbcbbd"),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#3E3232"),
    plot.title = element_text(size = 20),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = '#3E3232', color = NA),
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(linetype = 'dotted', color = "#dbcbbd",
                                      size = 0.5),
    axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10, color = "#dbcbbd"),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, color = "#dbcbbd"),
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 10)
  )
  
  
```

This theme more or less comes from [scheme color](https://www.schemecolor.com/golden-coffee.php). I'm going to settle on this graphic, because I need to get *something* done. 

Now, the graphic works well if you use developed countries, so I'm wondering how developing countries will do. Hopefully enough of them will be removed that I can safely plot them all.

    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, color = "#dbcbbd"),
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 10)
  )
```

As a final modification, I should probably use relative differences rather than absolute differences. But is that justified here? It's interesting to see the different absolute values as well. It gives you a sense of scale and difference between developed and developing countries.
